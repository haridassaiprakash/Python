For this reason, in the cases where non-integer steps are required, it is usually better to use the function np.linspace(). The np.linspace(start, stop, N) function returns N evenly spaced numbers over the closed interval [start, stop]. This means that both the start and thestop values are included. We should also note the np.linspace() function needs to be called with at least two arguments in the form np.linspace(start,stop). In this case, the default number of elements in the specified interval will be N= 50.
